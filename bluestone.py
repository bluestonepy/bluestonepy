bluestone.py - A Pythonic Minecraft Server

NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG.

                  strength: strong ----> weak
LICENSE: TODO: should it be AGPL or GPL or LGPL or Apache or MIT or CC0

This is a cleanroom implementation of the Minecraft server and the vanilla
survival game mode, and can be configured to support creative and adventure
game modes. It strives to be as feature complete as possible an to be highly
configurable by just writing a small ammount of python code. It is highly
scalable and can run within a cluseter or just on one node.

GOAL:
docstrings do not count nor do comments
500k lines max (10k sloc)
Entire cluster

Dependancies:
python3 or pypy3
enum
sortedcontainers
requests
cryptography
setuptools

user inputs should be processed immediately
outputs should be prioritized in accordance to some policy (ie nearest first)

class ServerBoss:
	'''
	This class combines the implementations and drives the server

	The idea is that this class takes parameters that are all
	highly configurable. This is the key to the design of the
	server. This reduces the ammount of work needed to modify
	a particular behavior of the server.

	Definitions:
	'''

	def freeze(self, file=None):
		'''
		This method saves the full state of this nodes
		server state. It relies on the fact that there
		are no globals that are not accessable via this
		object and that all objects that are reachable
		are pickle-able

		Args:
			file: an optional destination file, if provided can be
				str - a path to the destination file
				file - a writable file opened in binary mode
				None - insted this function will preform the
					operation in memory using BytesIO and
					will return the resulting bytes

		Raises:
			OSError: if the destination file could not be opened
			IOError: if the file was not opened writable
			TypeError: if the file was not opened in binary mode
				or if the file is not a str, a file, or None

			See open() and pickle for more information about exceptions

		Raises:

			IOError: if the file was not readable
